*Although not included in Project Instructions for SER-216 project deliverable, a Connect4Constants class has been added to Core folder to simplify functionality. Please include it in the Core folder when running the application.

*With all classes in their proper folders, first run Connect4Server class before running the Connect4Client class.

*In the Connect4Client terminal, follow prompts to launch the version of the game that you wish to play.
	**First select which game mode you would like:
		***P to play against another player (will require running the 			Connect4Client class a second time to launch a second terminal)
		***C for a computer opponent
	**Next select the display format:
		***T for a Text Console display (continues to use the Terminal)
		***G for a GUI display (launches a JavaFX Application)
